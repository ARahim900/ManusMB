## To-Do List

### Phase 1: Analyze provided files and requirements
- [x] Read `pasted_content.txt` for website instructions.
- [x] Read `Electricitydatabase.xlsx` to understand data structure.
- [x] Read `WaterSystemDatabase.xlsx` to understand data structure.
- [x] Read `STPPlantDatabase.xlsx` to understand data structure.
- [x] Read `ReserveFundCalculations.xlsx` to understand data structure.
- [x] Read `ContractorTracker.xlsx` to understand data structure.

### Phase 2: Design website structure and layout
- [x] Create a detailed plan for the React application structure based on the provided `src/` directory layout.
- [x] Define the main components (Sidebar, Header, MainContent, ModuleDashboard, etc.) and their responsibilities.
