# 🎨 Logo Setup Guide - Add Your MB 1.png Logo

## 📋 Quick Setup Instructions

Your Muscat Bay web app is now ready to display your custom MB 1.png logo! Follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Add Your Logo File
1. **Locate your `MB 1.png` file** from your GitHub repository
2. **Copy the file** to your project's public folder:
   ```
   ManusMB/public/mb-logo.png
   ```
3. **Rename it** to `mb-logo.png` (this ensures it matches the component code)

### Step 2: Verify Logo Display
1. **Refresh your web app** in the browser
2. The logo should now appear in:
   - ✅ **Sidebar header** (desktop)
   - ✅ **Mobile sidebar** 
   - ✅ **Collapsed sidebar** (shows smaller version)

### 📁 File Structure
```
ManusMB/
├── public/
│   ├── mb-logo.png          ← Your logo goes here
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── site.webmanifest
└── src/
    └── components/
        └── ui/
            └── Logo.jsx     ← Logo component (already created)
```

### 🔧 Logo Component Features
The Logo component automatically:
- **Displays your image** when `mb-logo.png` is present
- **Falls back to "MB" text** if image is missing
- **Adapts to collapsed/expanded** sidebar states
- **Responsive sizing** for different screen sizes
- **Smooth animations** and transitions

### 🎨 Logo Specifications
Your logo will work best with:
- **Format:** PNG (transparent background recommended)
- **Size:** 200x200px or larger (maintains quality when scaled)
- **Aspect Ratio:** Square or rectangular
- **Background:** Transparent or white

### 🚀 Alternative Method (if manual copy doesn't work)
If you have issues, you can also:
1. Download directly from your GitHub repo: 
   ```
   https://github.com/ARahim900/ManusMB/raw/main/MB%201.png
   ```
2. Save it as `mb-logo.png` in the `ManusMB/public/` folder

### ✅ Verification
Once added, your logo will be visible at:
- **Desktop:** http://localhost:3003 (sidebar)
- **Mobile:** Toggle the mobile menu to see it

**Need help?** The Logo component will show "MB" text if the image file isn't found, so you'll know if it needs to be added correctly.
